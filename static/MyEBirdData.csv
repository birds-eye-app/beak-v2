Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with.",630009418

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Amazing day of birding with huge numbers of sandpipers far beyond our identification abilities. Probably some uncommon or rares even scattered among the least and semipalmated. Sadly there also were a large number of injured birds too, mostly with injured or missing legs. Dipped on the avocet but got to see plenty of other outstanding birds. Conditions were muddy but still easily passable."

Very clearly heard one call too with short ascending call.,"A really delightful winter day at Randall’s. Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner.

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

We had seen numerous reports in eBird and very helpful comments on the NY discord highly recommended a stop at the feeders on circle road. Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road. I love a good difficult chase as much as the next birder, but it’s also nice to get a trip started with a few of your targets sighted off the bat. We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Song was constant throughout wooded sections,"Probably gotta be the best checklist and best trip we’ve done on the AT. Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road.

We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on.",630653977 630653979 630653981 630653983

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

We had seen numerous reports in eBird and very helpful comments on the NY discord highly recommended a stop at the feeders on circle road. Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road. I love a good difficult chase as much as the next birder, but it’s also nice to get a trip started with a few of your targets sighted off the bat. We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

We had seen numerous reports in eBird and very helpful comments on the NY discord highly recommended a stop at the feeders on circle road. Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road. I love a good difficult chase as much as the next birder, but it’s also nice to get a trip started with a few of your targets sighted off the bat. We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on.",630653968

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Thanks so very much to everyone from the NY discord for the tips on where to look, especially Jay! We stopped in about 4 different places on the road and listened for the chickadees. There were plentiful black-capped happily foraging and calling among the trees. We heard a few passing red-breasted nuthatches too and even got to lay eyes on a goldfinch for a bit. All in all not a bad morning even if we did dip on the target species. The dawn drive from tupper lake was gorgeous and we saw many a flock of crossbills gritting along the road. Hopefully we’ll get another shot at the boreals either on this trip or on a future one!"

We loved the two mail box feeders and their attendant Black-capped Chickadees, nuthatches and squirrels. We checked the dead snags along the trail but didn’t have sight or sound of the target rarity. A Hairy Woodpecker at the end certainly got our heart rate up, though!"

However, when we went to take Wallace for his morning walk, we quickly realized we were actually already surrounded by birds! I’m thinking there must be a feeder nearby, since there was truly a shocking number of birds calling and foraging through the trees on the edge of the lake. The highlight had to be a resplendent bald eagle was saw flying along the far lake shore."

We had seen numerous reports in eBird and very helpful comments on the NY discord highly recommended a stop at the feeders on circle road. Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road. I love a good difficult chase as much as the next birder, but it’s also nice to get a trip started with a few of your targets sighted off the bat. We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit).

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit).

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Song was constant throughout wooded sections,"Probably gotta be the best checklist and best trip we’ve done on the AT. Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner.

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

We had seen numerous reports in eBird and very helpful comments on the NY discord highly recommended a stop at the feeders on circle road. Nearly right after turning off the highway onto the road we were greeted by Red Crossbills. Even while driving, the bright flashes of red were unmistakeable! A bit further along, we neared the feeders and could see a flock of birds in the road. Approaching slowly we identified them as at least a dozen White-winged Crossbills pecking at the small bits of sand and gravel in the road. I love a good difficult chase as much as the next birder, but it’s also nice to get a trip started with a few of your targets sighted off the bat. We parked the car and started noting  and documenting the species at the feeders and also chatting with the incredibly friendly local birders too. The frequent crossbill sightings, chickadee dive bombs (I’m guessing our lack of outstretched hands of feed was drawing their ire) and nuthatch honking were more than enough for a very successful start to the trip! Then, as I was taking provably my 2,000th photo of a chickadee for the morning, Emily shouted and pointed to the top of one of the trees. Perched atop it was one of my 2 dream species for the trip: the pleasing grays, whites and blacks of a Canada Jay. This jay was quickly joined by another and set about hunting through the feeder options. The jays struck me with the apparent slowness of their flight (even more lackadaisical than their bluer cousins further south), and near total silence (completely unlike those rowdy cousins). I would have loved to linger even longer at the spot (and with hindsight… maybe we should have done so), but we were close to a possible spot for Boreal Chickadees so we ventured on."

Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end.

Went from NE corner along kill and then finished at old golf range. Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Ended up leading us to what has to be the coolest mixed flock of my life: pine warblers by the dozen, flashes of eastern bluebirds, brown headed nuthatches and red-cockaded woodpeckers squeezing their little lungs out. The colors and sounds made it feel like some sort of crazy southeastern pet store.  Top year and maybe life moment with the birds."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Song was constant throughout wooded sections,"Probably gotta be the best checklist and best trip we’ve done on the AT. Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Plentiful flocks of geese, gulls and shovelers along the NE corner. Finally made some progress on my gull ID by picking out an immature GBBG from afar. Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Highlight of the day was far and away the lifer Greater Scaup hanging out with an equally cute bufflehead in the western end of the Bronx kill. We ended up calling things short as the wind and chill were starting to get to us, but not before we had sparrow redemption with confident sightings of field sparrows (which we had mistaken a chipping sparrow for on our last visit). I had been very much hoping for an American tree sparrow too which all too briefly popped out at the very end. Only major dip was on the local kestrel(s) which we had hopped to catch up with."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."

Conditions were arguably poor, but I have to say a rainy hike has its own magic. I’ve never experienced the trail more birdy than this. From the moment we started to when we stopped we were surrounded by constant song and activity. The rain did nothing to dampen the songs and busy activity of summer. Willow flycatchers, yellow warblers and red-winged blackbirds were abundant along the boardwalk. An eastern phoebe pair again has set up shop at the end of the boardwalk. The woods were positively awash with song. The Ovenbird count is almost certainly a severe undercount as is the Veery and Wood Thrush too. Turns out there is just something beyond magical about a rainy hike where you’re basically serenaded by these the entire time. It’s also quite amazing how species can be found in basically the same exact spot each year: the phoebes at their nest, the Cerulean warbler in its stand of old growth along the first forested section and, best of all, the Indigo Bunting singing at the Cats Rock overlook. The only birds we really missed out on were the bobolinks in the field, though these are always a rare treat anyways. Speaking of Indigo Buntings, we’d like to extend a special thank you to the male who decided to break out in song 5 seconds into me proposing to Emily (also shoutout to the Prairie Warbler whose singing was also a constant presence there too). He was exactly where I hoped he would be and made the most amazing day all that more special. No new lifers today, but we’re both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together."
